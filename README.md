# Exersion
This Python-based application utilizes computer vision techniques mediapipe for keypoint detection and numpy for angle calculation to automatically count repetitions for curl-ups and squats in real-time. The app analyzes body movements through a web camera to track the start and completion of each repetition.

# ‚≠ê Features 
* Detect and count squats and curl-ups using computer vision.
* Let users choose a prompt between squats or curl-up count.
* Track and display the count on the screen.
* Counts both the left and right arms for curl-ups

# ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies used 
* Python
* OpenCV
* Mediapipe

# üí°How it functions
* Detects body keypoints using MediaPipe's Pose Model
* Monitors joint angles to identify upward and downward motion
* Counts repetitions on the full range of motion and predefined threshold
